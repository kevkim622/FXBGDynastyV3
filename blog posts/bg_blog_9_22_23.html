            <p>Well, here we are folks. It’s only been 2 weeks, and we’ve already aged 5 years. Aaron Rodgers tore his
                Achilles. Jonathan Taylor faked the IR (not that KFrance even cares). Nick Chubb ruptured every part of
                his knee (Honorable Mention: JK Dobbins). Cooper Kupp’s hamstring might be an injury for the long term.
                And last, and certainly the least - Drake London might lay multiple goose eggs this year should Arthur
                Smith stand by his balls-of-steel run-first-no-matter-what offense led by Bijan Robinson, and Lord knows
                why, Tyler Allgier.

                Despite these losses, we, as a community will continue doing what we do best - Making Bad Trades. That’s
                right. Some of you, including myself, will continue to send some of the most disgusting trade offers
                ever to be seen. Some of you will send some phenomenal offers, only to be declined by @RandallDaVandal
                or hit with a greedy counter-offer by @rinercs. Out of desperation, denial, and confirmation bias, we
                will cave on multiple transactions for the betterment of our dynasty squads.

                We will make many bad decisions together, hence our league name, “Only Bad Trades.”
            </p>
            <h3 class="p-2">With all that said, here is our season-long outlook as we approach Week 3. What will each
                team need in
                order to succeed? What may cause them to fail?

            <p class="p-2">Let’s just get this one out of the way. We all know that Kev will most likely walk away with
                another
                title - He is in the stronger division, but has a strong, young roster and always manages to squeeze
                first round picks out of everyone desperate for his players. Kev is a Fantasy Siren, he will lure you in
                with the only appealing offers you’ll receive during the season, but at the end of the day HE KNOWS he
                will have the upperhand and you will be left in turmoil and ruin. He is a true Dynasty Degenerate and
                practically lives and breathes sports as a full-time passion. Kev’s all-time sweetheart, Saquon Barkley
                is facing yet another nagging ankle injury - but fear not! On the same roster lies Bijan Robinson and
                Jahmyr Gibbs. Can’t complain with Josh Allen, Diggs, Olave, Brown, Lamb, Keenan Allen AND Cooper Kupp on
                the same team as well. No matter how informed Kevin Kim is of the game, the injury gods always find
                their way back to him.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>As long as Kev’s players perform to expectation he should have a solid season ahead of him. Stay calm,
                don’t lust for more fantasy dime pieces, let Allen/Diggs lead the way. Kev will continue to pry
                leaguemates with his soul-sucking offers, and it surprisingly works.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>Extreme case of bad luck and injuries.

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">Frederick Families (0-2)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">

            </p>
            <p class="p-2">Transitioning to the complete opposite end of the spectrum, we have the Frederick Families.
                Ironically, this team has to be the least family-oriented roster in the league and the weekly
                projections going forward look absolutely disgusting. This team is clearly still struggling years after
                its divorce from Josh Allen and his firstborn, Stefon Diggs. Who would have thought that trading Allen
                for Trevor Lawrence, Jonathan Taylor and Brandon Aiyuk, would eventually turn into Deshaun Watson and a
                barren lineup? This manager needs therapy to turn this “Family” around and stop gravitating towards
                toxic players (ie. Antonio Brown, Henry Ruggs, Kadarius Toney, Deshaun Watson, etc.).
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>Success for this team is a bit different from everyone else. Brian and the Frederick Families need to
                commit to their future and solidify their race to the bottom. Accept the humility, execute a strong
                tanking season, and do whatever it takes to secure the 1.01 Pick in 2024. STOP MAKING STUPID DECISIONS
                JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE BORED. CJ Stroud provides a glimmer of hope for this team’s future and provides, at
                a minimum, a solid QB2 floor if Brian can acquire a top tier QB such as Caleb Williams or Drake Maye.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>If this fool gets coaxed into selling his own 2024 Pick during his tanking season, that is the Ultimate
                “L”. Not fully committing to the rebuild will be disastrous for years to come. “Burn this b*tch to the
                ground.”

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">LA Boneyard (1-1)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 240.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 294.78

            </p>
            <p class="p-2">Sitting #2 behind the Dinosaur Nuggies in the Monstars Division, Josh Honaker with LA
                Boneyard is looking to make a playoff push in this year’s “Mid-off.” Ranked Consensus #5 by the rest of
                the league, LA Boneyard is looking to show the world that they can compete even with the scraps found
                out back. Truly though, given the unforeseen circumstances that have occurred already in these first two
                weeks, Josh could make a real push to the finals - especially if other managers are hit with a bad case
                of injuries. LA Boneyard is led by its trusty new steed, Justin Herbert - who will undoubtedly need to
                throw a lot more due to the Charger’s piss-poor defense and supposedly more “pass-friendly” OC. Not only
                that, this roster is now the home of a very robust RB group of risers: Travis Etienne, Rhamondre
                Stevenson, Javonte Williams, and D’Andre Swift who dropped a very reliable 25 points against the Vikings
                - exciting stuff!
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>It will take a mixture of faith, waivers and FAAB to win some dirty matchups here and there, but Honaker
                will need to take pride in some of his middle tier players who will surprise all of us. For example,
                nobody cares about Brock Purdy, but you know what you will get and he will gift Honaker with a few good
                games strictly due to the team that surrounds him.

            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>The injury bug will not only affect his opponents, but injuries can catch up to Honaker as well. If
                Metcalf, Waddle and other pillar players continue to struggle with lingering injuries - LA Boneyard may
                struggle to stay up to date with injury reports and pickups mainly because he actually has a life and
                responsibilities outside of Fantasy/Dynasty Football.

            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 246.58 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 153.78
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">If there is any time for Greg and the Boulder Boulders to make a run for the trophy, it is
                this year. Seriously. As long as Christian McCaffrey is alive and well, Greg has the highest floor out
                of any team in the league - that’s how freaking dominant CMC is. With the rising of Tua Tagovailoa and
                Justin Fields, upside of Deebo Samuel, reliable targets of Davante Adams, and an additional top 3 RB
                from last year in Josh Jacobs - one can make a solid argument that the Boulder Boulders will ROCK this
                year (haha…my life is so sad…)! Greg also owns a handful of young, high-pedigree players such as Garrett
                Wilson, Treylon Burks and Breece Hall - all of which in some gross situations, but their raw talent
                alone may reap a few promising matchups. Lastly, Jerry Jeudy (when healthy) is still the WR1 on a still
                gross, but better Denver Broncos, and will see his fair share of targets as he gets back to full health.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>Greg will need to persevere through many of the ugly situations his players find themselves in and he
                will have to discern WHEN and WHERE to play certain pieces of his lineup. Breece Hall’s season was
                dimmed with the fall of Aaron Rodgers, but he should still have his positive matchups every now and then
                because he’s just so efficient when he’s given the rock. CMC is the cornerstone of this roster, just
                play him no matter what.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>CMC is a freak of nature, but he can only take the team so far. Should anything happen to CMC, Justin
                Fields really needs to get his sh*t together fast. He has had some incredibly high ceilings last year,
                but his lows are straight up gross. Greg’s team as a whole is going to be Boom or Bust, so if he plays
                the wrong player in the wrong week - it could bite him in the butt.
            </p>

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">Texas 2-12’ers (1-1)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 215.96 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 215.64
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">Sigh. Where do we even begin? There are so many mean things I could say about this team, but
                I’m just gonna say one roast and get back to the facts. Whoever owns and operates the Applebee’s in
                Central Park, Fredericksburg has to be the same owner who manages the Texas 2-12’ers - this team is
                average AT BEST. With the 1.01 Pick in the 2022 Draft, Dehlbom drafted KENNY PICKETT. Then, this same
                man proceeded to draft about 5 additional low-end QB3’s - but hey not gonna lie, Baker Mayfield is
                popping off compared to expectation. All that said, Dehlbom refuses to make trades that bring value to
                his team because he’s too high on all of his players. No one knows if he is trying to contend or if he
                is planning on losing. In reality, he should be racing the Frederick Families to the bottom, but somehow
                the rest of the league ranked him consensus #4 this year - and for that, he is labeled as a FRAUD
                contender for the 2023/2024 season. Shoutout to TJ Hockenson though, he is a high-upside TE1 moving
                forward.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>The Grace of God. Although, by naming themselves the Texas 2-12’ers, this team is already on track to
                meet their self-proclaimed record and we are only two games in. Bravo! He is relying on Murphy’s Law,
                “What can happen, will happen.” By drafting so many QB’s in a 10-team superflex league, there is a
                *chance* that some of his QB’s have good weeks. Although, Desmond Ridder looks soooooooooooooo bad right
                now.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>Himself. If he does not take action right now, he could jeopardize the future of his team by not making a
                run for a top tier prospect in the 2024 draft - but maybe he thinks Quinn Ewers is his guy? I have no
                idea.

                Carter’s “Durham TyReek & Destroy” is sitting pretty at the top of the Tune Squad Division. He is
                without a doubt proving his haters wrong so far as he was ranked consensus #8 in our season long
                projections. Is this just a fairytale or will it be reality moving forward? We have yet to see. From a
                dynasty perspective, this is an OLD roster that’s being held together by Derrick Henry (My fav RB ever),
                Tyreek Hill, Mike Evans, and Amari Cooper. While half his team is going to retire soon, there is some
                light at the end of the tunnel - Devonta Smith is proving himself to be a true and worth WR1. While AJ
                Brown is viewed as the alpha, Smith is more like the WR1B before he is a WR2. In fact, Smith is
                outperforming AJ Brown by a WIDE margin, but we will see how long this will carry on. At the very least,
                Carter did make one long-term decision, and that was to trade up for the shorty Bryce Young at the 1.03.
                It’s a rough start for the rookie so far, but time will tell if he can overcome the adversities faced
                with leading the Panthers.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>The old men on Carter’s roster need to continue to show out, because Ryan Tannehill and Dak Prescott
                won’t cut it. Tyreek and Evans are known to have big weeks, so as long as they stay in rhythm, Carter
                will remain contending within the Tune Squad Division. We must also remember, it is not cold yet, and
                that is when Derrick Henry is at his prime. Once the temperature drops, Derrick Yeti will drop some
                bombs in his matchups.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>No matter how hard they try, old age will always catch up to players. Should anything happen to Tyreek
                Hill or Mike Evans during the season, count Carter out. Also, Tannehill is going to make you so mad in
                multiple matches going forward - it’s in his blood. He sucks.

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">Chincoteague Sharts (0-2)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 252.06 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 283.58
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">The Chincoteague Sharts failed to live up to their name last season by winning the
                Championship and seizing the League Title. The initiative was carried out by the likes of Patrick
                Mahomes, Jalen Hurts, Travis Kelce, and Jonathan Taylor. Kevin France, however, has faced a streak of
                bad luck over the past two weeks and is now sitting at 0-2 on the season - what a loser, haha! All jokes
                aside, he is primed for a bounceback now that Kelce is reunited with Mahomes and Jalen Hurts’ floor will
                hopefully recalibrate as the season progresses. It doesn’t help that Jonathan Taylor was placed on IR
                due to the ineptitude of the Colts. All things considered, Kevin France is still a terrible manager on
                what should be the best team. You would think that this Computer Science major would have no life
                outside of work, but no, he has a girlfriend and is just a quality guy on top of that. Dynasty Football
                is secondary, and because of that, we hate him - even though he’s amazing inside and out.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>Bro has the best QB tandem in the league. Because of that, he should be walking himself into the playoffs
                every year - but he rarely checks Sleeper. Travis Kelce also stamped his dominance in Kansas City but
                how putrid their offense has been without him. Despite being a TE, Kelce remains the WR1 for the Chiefs
                even at the ripe age of 33. Once JT is back, he will be an immovable force. Imagine if Kevin actually
                had a WR1 in fantasy…
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>Kevin’s abundance of priorities outside of Dynasty Football could lead to his team’s demise, but I don’t
                think he cares. He doesn’t have to try to win games half the time, but in the other 50% of games, his
                lack of focus may turn on him, eventually. From a less salty POV that’s more factual, France actually
                has a very weak WR corps, at least, he lacks the WR depth that other leaguemates have.

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">Tucson Trash Pandas (1-1)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 239.96 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 229.3
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">Sitting currently at #3 in the Monstars Division, Randy and the Tucson Trash Pandas are
                making a run for contention and hoping to best the Dinosaur Nuggies and the Chincoteague Sharts
                somewhere in the playoffs. No other team in the league has a ritual as unique and specific as the Trash
                Pandas - which is to draft wide receivers strictly from LSU. Who can blame him? By having Ja’Marr Chase
                and Justin Jefferson at your disposal, it gives other leaguemates reason to be weary. With Hopkins at
                WR3 and Mark Andrews at TE, this team loves to catch balls. RB will be the biggest question mark after
                JK Dobbins is out for the season, AGAIN. Tony Pollard is in for a big season, at least, we believe so
                with the departure of Ezekiel Elliot. After him, Randy only has a bunch of backups - so he is truly
                banking on air yards this season. One could be quick to dismiss his QB room with Cousins, Russel Wilson
                and Daniel Jones - but these guys WILL have their weeks. D Jones is straight up @$$ but his rushing
                upside is no joke and he has surprised us in the past with some outrageously high ceilings.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>Justin Jefferson needs to continue doing what he’s always been doing, and we really need Joe Burrow and
                the Bengals to step it up so that Chase recoups his value. Would you believe me if I said that Kirk
                Cousins is currently the QB1 on the season right now? Because he is. And he will need to maintain this
                potential should Randy have any hope to beat his tough division. Especially with Andrews at TE, he needs
                to start producing TE1 numbers again to make up for the losses at RB.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>Randy’s indecision during trades and questionably high evaluations of certain players makes it
                challenging for him to pivot and make transactions when players are at their peak - so it is unlikely
                that we see him take the necessary risks to improve his roster. Therefore, the most likely cause for
                failure will simply be his division mates having better lineups at the end of the day.

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">Duuval Dirty Dogs (0-2)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 188.62 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 234.46
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">If anyone is the golden retriever in this division, it’s Gene and the Duuval Dirty Dogs.
                Gene’s immense level of childish optimism balances Kev Kim’s daily negativity and harassment, and that
                is why this league is still standing today. He has a true love for the game despite making
                counterintuitive trade decisions. On one hand, you would think he is rebuilding by fire-selling his
                whole team and even acquiring Trevor Lawrence. Then on the flip of a hat, he gives his 2024 and 2025
                Firsts to Kev for 28 year old Austin Ekeler. With Calvin Ridley and Amon Ra St Brown at WR, Kenneth
                Walker at RB2, Gene will have his victories, but sitting at 0-2 already, it looks like it’s going to be
                a middle to low pack run for the Dirty Dogs.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>Trevor Lawrence is the Dynasty Golden Child, and is primed for years of football excellence. We have yet
                to see him become a weekly fantasy contributor despite being surrounded by a good amount of talent,
                which means, maybe he is a good offensive line away from complete and utter domination - but when that
                happens is a huge question mark. In order for the Dirty Dogs to see more wins, Austin Ekeler needs to be
                healthy.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>The lack of depth for this roster is definitely a cause for concern, but there is not turning back now as
                Gene’s given away his 2024 first to Kev for an Austin Ekeler that’s sitting out due to a pesky knee
                injury. If Gene places outside of 3rd, and the lower rankings earn higher picks in next year’s draft -
                we might be able to call Gene the Ultimate Loser this season because he won’t have picks to make up for
                this year’s deficit.

            <h5 class="p2 fw-bolder">Sugar Tit Bungos (1-1)</h5>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">
                PF: 234.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PA: 274.64
            </p>
            <p class="p-2">Colton and The Sugar Tit Bungos were ranked consensus #9 BEFORE both Aaron Rodgers and Nick
                Chubb were added to the season-long IR. Luckily enough, these losses are far from enough to beat out the
                Frederick Families to the bottom. Even then, Colton gave away his 2024 1st Round Pick to get back his
                own 2024 2nd and 3rd Picks from Kev Kim in addition to Kev’s 2024 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th Rd Picks…If that
                singular action does not communicate it enough - This team DOES NOT GIVE A F*CK. Colton pays $50 into
                the trash every year just to flex on us and let us know we need to get better jobs and live better
                lives. Unlike The Frederick Families and Texas 2-12’ers, Colton’s loyalty to the Bengals is not hurting
                his team, but rather the opposite, it holds his squad together. To have Joe Burrow on your Dynasty Squad
                with Tee Higgins and Joe Mixon gives you a nice floor against opponents at the least. Due to injuries,
                Colton has a few bench players that turned into startable assets in Kyren Williams and Nico Collins so
                we’ll see how the Bungos hold up throughout the season. Even Jared Goff will eat a little bit this year
                with the rise of the Lions. In reality, Colton has enough upside to make a playoff run, and he might as
                well try being that he has no 1st to use next year.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What he needs to succeed:</p>
            <p>The Lions hype needs to be legit if Colton wants to get his league deposit back. Having a solid QB2 b as
                ehind Burrow will take him farther than most would think. There will be a lot of garbage time points
                coming his way.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold pb-2">What can cause him to fail:</p>
            <p>If Joe Burrow’s calf strain negatively progresses or is reaggravated, it will affect his weekly scores
                dramatically. Without Burrow, Tee Higgins will not be receiving as much value in the air and Mixon is
                not efficient enough to fill in the deficit of Burrow’s absence or lowered quality of play.
